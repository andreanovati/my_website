# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

```{r}
yrbss%>%
  skim() %>%
  filter(n_missing > 0)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

We are missing 1004 weight observations. The distribution is positivly skewed (scores bunched at low values with the tail pointing to high values).

```{r, eda_on_weight}
favstats(~weight, data=yrbss)

yrbss$weight%>%
  skim()
```

```{r}
yrbss%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  ggplot(aes (x=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal()+
  NULL
yrbss%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  ggplot(aes (x=weight))+
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal()+
  NULL
```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. Use the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}

yrbss_1 <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d>3, "yes", "no")) %>%
  na.omit()

yrbss_1 %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarise(n=n())

yrbss_1 %>%
  count(physical_3plus)

```

Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?
```{r CI interval}

prop.test(3583,8351, conf.level = 0.95)

```

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

It is hard to deduce a relationship from the boxplots, but the weight distribution of the proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week seems to have more extreme values, especially extreme high values. So we can expect population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week to have more obesity cases.

```{r, boxplot}

yrbss_1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=physical_3plus,y=weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
  

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

yrbss_2 <- yrbss_1 %>%
  select(physical_3plus,weight)

#confidence interval for physical > 3
yrbss_yes <- yrbss_2 %>%
  filter(physical_3plus == "yes") %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            sd_weight = sd(weight),
            count = n()) %>%
  mutate(ci_up_yes = mean_weight + qt(0.975,count-1)*sd_weight/sqrt(count),
         ci_down_yes = mean_weight - qt(0.975,count-1)*sd_weight/sqrt(count))
  
#confidence interval for physical < = 3 
yrbss_no <- yrbss_2 %>%
  filter(physical_3plus == "no") %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            sd_weight = sd(weight),
            count = n()) %>%
  mutate(ci_up_no = mean_weight + qt(0.975,count-1)*sd_weight/sqrt(count),
         ci_down_no = mean_weight - qt(0.975,count-1)*sd_weight/sqrt(count))
  

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss_2)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss_2 %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

#stat = 1.09 

```


Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0. 


After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss_2 %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hypothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

Null hypothesis: zero difference between the two (Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton)
Alternative hypothesis: significant difference between the two

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}

movies1 <- movies%>%
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>%
  select(director,rating)

#t test
t.test(rating~director, data=movies1)

#infer 
movies_dist <- movies1 %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

```



```{r plot}
#Plot
library(ggrepel)
movies_plot <- movies1%>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating=sd(rating),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_rating=sd_rating/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se_rating,
            rating_low=mean_rating - margin_of_error,
            rating_high=mean_rating + margin_of_error)%>%
  mutate(directorf = factor(director, levels = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")))

ggplot(movies_plot) +
  geom_point(aes(x=mean_rating, y=directorf, colour = fct_rev(directorf))) +
  geom_errorbar( width=0.5,inherit.aes = F, aes(xmin=rating_low,xmax=rating_high, y=directorf, colour = fct_rev(directorf))) +
  geom_rect(xmin=7.27, xmax=7.33, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, color = NA, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title="Do Spielberg & Burton have the same IMDB mean rating?", subtitle= "95% confidence intervals overlap", x="IMDB Rating", y="Director")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  geom_text_repel(aes(x=mean_rating, y= directorf, label = round(mean_rating, digits=2)))+
  geom_text_repel(aes(x=rating_low, y= directorf, label = round(rating_low, digits=2)))+
  geom_text_repel(aes(x=rating_high, y= directorf, label = round(rating_low, digits=2)))
  

```

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
salary_diff <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary),
            std_salary=sd(salary),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_salary=std_salary/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se_salary,
            CI_low=mean_salary - margin_of_error,
            CI_high=mean_salary + margin_of_error)
salary_diff
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

From our analysis we can conclude the mean salary by gender differs, but that the range of the mean does not differ if we consider a confidence interval of 95%. The margin of error seems quite high.

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)


# hypothesis testing using infer package
salary_in_Null <- omega %>%
  specify (salary ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize (null="independence") %>%
  generate (reps=1000, type="permute") 

mean_diff <- omega %>% 
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))

salary_in_Null %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff, direction = "two-sided")


```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

From our analysis, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean difference salary between men and women is 0. We can conclude that the mean is higher for male

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

The issue of distinguishable differences between male and female salaries was raised at the board meeting, though this was attributed to other factors, one of which being differences in experience: Using evidence from a questionnaire sent to the 50 executives in the sample, we can see that the average duration of experience for males was 21 years approx. and for females it was 7 years approx.




```{r, experience_stats}

# Summarised statistics of salary grouped by gender


favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

```{r}
experience_diff <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_exp = mean(experience),
            std_exp=sd(experience),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_exp=std_exp/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se_exp,
            CI_low=mean_exp - margin_of_error,
            CI_high=mean_exp + margin_of_error) 

experience_diff

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
exp_in_Null <-omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute")
  
exp_mean_diff <- omega %>% 
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))

exp_in_Null %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = exp_mean_diff, direction = "two-sided")
```


We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives: the mean male experience, which is greater than the mean female experience, is more than one st. dev away from the aforementioned mean female experience. This finding may  lends support to the difference in male and female salaries. But it endangers the causality from gender to salary: the difference between the salaries of male and female may be caused by the difference of experience, a third variable, instead of the gender difference.


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
omega %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=experience, y=salary))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title="Relationship between salary and experience",
       y="salary",
       x="experience")

```
Years of experience and salary are positively related. Someone with more years of working experience is more likely to receive higher salaries and vice versa.



## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}

omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% 
  #order the variables that appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

Based on the plot, at the same level of experience, women still earn less than men on average. Therefore, we can conclude that gender based pay discrimination does exist in the workplace despite the importance of years of experience.


# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
yield_curve  %>% 
  mutate(duration=factor(duration, levels=c("3-Month Treasury Bill", "6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate","3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate"))) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=duration)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ duration, ncol=2)+
  labs(title="Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       y="Yield(%)",
       x="Date",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
yield_curve_2 <- yield_curve  %>%
  mutate(year=factor(year(date)), 
         maturity=factor(maturity, levels=c("3m", "6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y")))

yield_curve_2 %>%
  filter(date>="1999-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=value, group=date, color=year)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol=4)+
  labs(title="U.S. yield curve",
       y="Yield(%)",
       x="Maturity",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r treasury_rates}

yield_curve_3 <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(date>="1999-01-01", maturity =="3m" | maturity =="10y") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=duration, group=maturity))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-Month and 10-Year U.S. Treasury Rates since 1999",
       y="Yield(%)",
       x="Date",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")
yield_curve_3
```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.


```{r}
yield_curve_spread <- yield_curve %>%
  select(date, maturity, value)%>%
  filter(maturity == "3m" | maturity == "10y")%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = maturity, values_from = value)

colnames(yield_curve_spread) <- c("date", "three_month", "ten_year")

yield_curve_spread <- yield_curve_spread%>%
  mutate(diff = ten_year - three_month)

recessions_1 <- recessions %>%
  filter(year(From) >= 1960)

```

```{r}

# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"),
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr",
                skip=2)
```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(col = ("1970":"2017"), names_to = "Year",values_to = "Value_bn") %>%
  transform(Value_bn = Value_bn/1e9) %>%
  transform(Year = as.numeric(Year))

tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Final consumption expenditure")] <- "Final_consumption_expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)")] <- "Household_expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure")] <- "Government_expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation")] <- "Gross_capital_formation"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables")] <- "Gross_fixed_capital_formation"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services")] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services")] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")] <-"GDP"

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```


First, can you produce this plot?

```{r gdp1, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
components_GDP <- c("Household_expenditure","Gross_capital formation", "Government_expenditure", "Exports", "Imports")

tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% components_GDP & Country %in% country_list) %>%
  transform(IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c("Gross_capital_formation", "Exports", "Government_expenditure", "Household_expenditure", "Imports"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,y = Value_bn))+
  facet_wrap(vars(Country))+
  geom_line(aes(group = IndicatorName,color = IndicatorName))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())+
  scale_color_hue(name = "GDP Components",
                  labels = c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports"))+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$")
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

The % difference between calcualted GDP and the GDP from UN dataframe is shown in the table below (including avg, median, max and min). 

```{r}
library("scales")
GDP_data_wider <- tidy_GDP_data[c(1,2,4,3,5)] %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = ("CountryID":"Value_bn"), names_from = "IndicatorName", values_from = "Value_bn") %>%
  select("CountryID":"Year","GDP","Household_expenditure","Gross_capital_formation","Government_expenditure","Exports","Imports") %>%
  mutate(Household_expenditure_percent = Household_expenditure/GDP,
         Gross_capital_formation_percent = Gross_capital_formation/GDP,
         Government_expenditure_percent = Government_expenditure/GDP,
         Net_export_percent = (Exports - Imports)/GDP,
         GDP_diff = (Household_expenditure + Gross_capital_formation + Government_expenditure + Exports - Imports - GDP)/GDP)

GDP_data_wider %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(Average = mean(GDP_diff),
            Median = median(GDP_diff),
            Max = max(GDP_diff),
            Min = min(GDP_diff)) %>%
  transform(Average = percent(Average),
            Median = percent(Median),
            Max = percent(Max),
            Min = percent(Min)) %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "GDP Difference in Percentage") %>%
  kable_classic()
```


```{r gdp2, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

The graphs depict the overall trend in components of the GDP for India, USA, and Germany since 1970. 

It can be seen that Germany's household expenditure has contributed around 60% to its GDP and has remained fairly constant over the years. The contribution of its government expenditure as well as Gross capitak formation has also remained stable. However, in more recent years, the country's net exports have started contributing more towards its GDP as Germany has increased its manufacturing sector. 

On the other hand, contribution of household expenditure to India's GDP has reduced over time and the Gross capital formation has increased. This is because India is developing rapidly and the government has made sure to invest in infrastructure. Net exports have also increased in the past few years and are predicted to contribute more to the GDP as India accelerates its spend in manufacturing.

Contribution of household expenditure in the US has increased over time. This is expected as it is a developed nation and discretionary income tends to be higher. Net exports have remained fairly stable as the US has had a falling manufacturing sector for years. Government expensiture has also fallen while overall gross capital formation has increased. 


> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like

```{r}
country_list_2 <- c("Brazil","Australia", "Belgium")

components_GDP <- c("Household_expenditure","Gross_capital formation", "Government_expenditure", "Exports", "Imports")

tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% components_GDP & Country %in% country_list_2) %>%
  transform(IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c("Gross_capital_formation", "Exports", "Government_expenditure", "Household_expenditure", "Imports"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,y = Value_bn))+
  facet_wrap(vars(Country))+
  geom_line(aes(group = IndicatorName,color = IndicatorName))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())+
  scale_color_hue(name = "GDP Components",
                  labels = c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports"))+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$")

```

The graphs depict the overall trend in components of the GDP for Brazil, Australia, and Belgium since 1970.
All three economies have been growing and all components of the GDP have increased.Government Expenditure in Brazil and Australia have both increased drastically since 1970.This is because the government is trying to develop the economy in Brazil. Exports from Brazil have also increased as the agriculture industry has grown. 

Australia's gross capital formation has increased as the economy opened itself up over the years. Exports have also increased as the country became part of new trade deals. 
Belgium's household income has increased the most compared to all the other components. It moves extremely closely with the gross capital formation. Government expenditure has increased but not as quickly as the other countries. As Belgium si also part of the EU, it exports have also not grown as quickly.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
