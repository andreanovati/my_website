# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about?
Variable types are strings for country and values for the other five variables. 
There are no missing values (results for is.na(drinks) are hidden). 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
glimpse(drinks)

```

There are no missing values (output for is.na(drinks) is hidden)
```{r, results='hide'}
is.na(drinks)

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries


```{r beer_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
drinks %>%
  slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country,beer_servings)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=beer_servings, y=country)) + 
  geom_col(fill="blue") +
  labs(title ="Top 25 beer consuming countries", x= "Country", y="Beer Servings")

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
drinks %>%
  slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country,wine_servings)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wine_servings, y=country)) + 
  geom_col(fill="blue")+
  labs(title ="Top 25 wine consuming countries", x= "Country", y="Wine Servings")

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
drinks %>%
  slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n=25) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country,spirit_servings)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=spirit_servings, y=country)) + 
  geom_col(fill="blue")+
  labs(title ="Top 25 spirit consuming countries", x= "Country", y="Spirit Servings")

```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

**Answer**
The first graph displays the top 25 beer consuming countries from highest to lowest. It can be seen that Namibia, Czech Republic, Gabon, Germany, and Poland are the top 5 countries. Germany, Czech Republic, and Poland’s higher positions are not unexpected since the population in these countries are famous for beer consumption and tend to have a lot of local breweries too.  Namibia, on the other hand, as a top beer consuming country is surprising since it is not generally associated with beer. However, due to colonial ties with Germany, it's rank is probably justifiable. 
The second graph depicts the top 25 wine consuming countries in descending order. The top 5 countries are France, Portugal, Andorra, Switzerland, and Denmark. Once again, these results are not surprising given that the wine drinking culture is prevalent in most European countries. These countries also have the best and most famous vineyards in the world. Since Ireland is more famous for its beers, not being in the top of the list was expected.
Lastly, the third graph shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries. Grenada, Belarus, Russian Federation, Haiti, and St. Lucia are the Top 5. Russian Federation and Belarus’ positions in the top 5 are expected as they are known for spirits like Vodka. However, Grenada, Haiti, and St. Lucia’s positions as top spirit consuming nations were unexpected. Poland, known for its spirits, was relatively lower in the list which was surprising. 
Unsurprisingly, Islamic nations don't make it on the list since their culture does not permit consumption of alcohol.





# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv")) %>%
  clean_names()
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 


## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:


- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?  
There are no missing values (is.na(movies) results are hidden)
```{r, results='hide'}
is.na(movies)

```

All entries are distinct (results are hidden as well)
```{r, results='hide'}
duplicated(movies)

```

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE) %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order 
```{r}
movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(avg_gross = mean(gross), 
            avg_budget=mean(budget)) %>%
  mutate(return_on_budget = ((avg_gross - avg_budget)/avg_budget)*100) %>%
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget)) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(
    total_gross = sum(gross),
    avg_gross = mean(gross),
    median_gross = median(gross),
    sd_gross = sd(gross),
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = total_gross, n=15) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```


- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 

```{r}
#table
movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(rating),
    min_rating = min(rating), 
    max_rating = max(rating), 
    median_rating = median(rating), 
    sd_rating = sd(rating)
  ) %>%
  arrange(mean_rating) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

#histogram
ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating)) + 
    geom_histogram() 

#faceted by genre 
ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating)) + 
    geom_histogram() +   #include both "total" histogram and faceted ones 
  facet_wrap(~genre) 

#density graph 
ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating)) + 
    geom_density()

```


## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") 

```

**Answer** The number of facebook likes that the cast has received is not a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office based on our scatterplot, because viewers have personal preferences regarding the movie cast and certain people's preference cannot decide the earnings of a movie.


  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

**Answer** Budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office, because normally a high-budget movie would bring audiences a better viewing experience regarding the visual and sound effect, polularity of movie casts, plot, etc.  
  
  
  
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, y=gross)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

**Answer** IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office, because high ratings from a well known ratings and reviews website would encourage more people to see the movie, which would then increase the earnings of that movie.   

# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
glimpse(nyse)
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}
# Table 
nyse_1 <- nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(number=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number))
nyse_1

nyse_1 %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()


#Bar plot 
ggplot(nyse_1,aes(y=reorder(sector,-number),x=number)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(y="Sector",x="Number of Companies")

```


Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The following code 


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Now let us downlaod prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly_1 <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarise(min_month = min(monthly_returns), 
            max_month = max(monthly_returns), 
            median_month = median(monthly_returns),
            mean_month = mean(monthly_returns), 
            sd_month = sd(monthly_returns)
  ) %>% 
  view()
myStocks_returns_monthly_1

myStocks_returns_monthly_1 %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns)) + 
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~symbol)

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 
**Answer** Based on this plot, we can infer that diversification leads to less variability in monthly returns. This inference can be made by looking at the SPY (S&P500 index) plot which has the lowest variability in returns. The riskiest stock is Apple as it has the greatest variability in returns, and the least risky stock is Johnson and Johnson (JNJ).

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
library(ggrepel)
myStocks_returns_monthly_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sd_month,y=mean_month,label = symbol)) +
  geom_text_repel()+
  geom_point()

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?
**Answer** We can infer that there is a weakly positive correlation between mean monthly returns and monthly standard deviation of returns, though there are outliers. For example, CSCO has a lower mean monthly return than INTC, yet has a greater monthly return standard deviation. However, if we incorporate dividend yields into the return arithmetic , this may be a different story.


# Is inflation transitory?


> You may find useful the material on [downloading economic data from the FRED](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/#data-from-the-federal-reserve-economic-data-with-tidyquant). 

A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claimed that the [Current Inflation Spike Is Just Transitory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/current-inflation-spike-is-just-transitory-new-bis-study-argues). As the article says, 


> The surge in inflation seen across major economies is probably short lived because it’s confined to just a few sectors of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements. 

> New research by the BIS’s Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Egon Zakrajsek and Dora Xia adds to one of the hottest debates in economics -- how long the current surge in consumer prices will last. Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his euro-area counterpart Christine Lagarde have said the pickup is probably transitory, despite a snarled global supply chain and a spike in energy prices. 

You have to download data for CPI and the 10 year bill and produce the following graph


```{r cpi_10year, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_10year.png"), error = FALSE)
```


The relevant indicators from FRED are:

- [Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- [10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GS10)


```{r, get_cpi_10Year_yield}

cpi  <-   tq_get("CPIAUCSL", get = "economic.data",
                       from = "1980-01-01") %>% 
  rename(cpi = symbol,  # FRED data is given as 'symbol' and 'price'
         rate = price) %>% # we rename them to what they really are, e.g., cpi and rate
  
  # calculate yearly change in CPI by dividing current month by same month a year (or 12 months) earlier, minus 1
  mutate(cpi_yoy_change = rate/lag(rate, 12) - 1)

ten_year_monthly  <-   tq_get("GS10", get = "economic.data",
                       from = "1980-01-01") %>% 
  rename(ten_year = symbol,
         yield = price) %>% 
  mutate(yield = yield / 100) # original data is not given as, e.g., 0.05, but rather 5, for five percent

# we have the two dataframes-- we now need to join them, and we will use left_join()
# base R has a function merge() that does the same, but it's slow, so please don't use it

mydata <- 
  cpi %>% 
  left_join(ten_year_monthly, by="date") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = year(date), # using lubridate::year() to generate a new column with just the year
    month = month(date, label = TRUE),
    decade=case_when(
      year %in% 1980:1989 ~ "1980s",
      year %in% 1990:1999 ~ "1990s",
      year %in% 2000:2009 ~ "2000s",
      year %in% 2010:2019 ~ "2010s",
      TRUE ~ "2020s"
      )
  )

```

```{r}
#reproducing the chart 
mydata <- na.omit(mydata)
glimpse(mydata)

mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=cpi_yoy_change, y=yield, label=date, color = decade)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  geom_text_repel()+
  facet_wrap(~decade, ncol=1, scales="free")+ 
  labs( x = "CPI yearly change", y = "10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate", title= "How are CPI and 10-year yield related?")+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```

Inflation Graph Interpretation:
There is a clear positive correlation between CPI yearly change (inflation) and the 10-year Constant Maturity Treasury yield. Moreover, the pattern is evident across all decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s), giving more accuracy to the pattern. Clearly, as inflation is higher, nominal interest rates increase to adjust to the increase is prices. However, it is very important to take into consideration the slope of the line of best fit. To be precise, since across all decades, the slope of the line of best fit is less than 1 (<1), we can say that as inflation (CPI YoY change) increases there is a decrease in real interest rates. Thus, although nominal interest rates are positively correlated with inflation, real interest rates are not. The reasoning: when the central bank sets real interest rates high, money supply decreases having a adverse impact on inflation (and thus the negative correlation between real interest rates and inflation).


# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the  article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgound and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))

```

You may find counties that as of September 2021 have 0% vaccination; don't discard them immediately, try to find out why you have zeros!

**Answer：** The zeros may come from the counties where vaccination would be better estimated by Percent of Total Pop with at least one Dose by State of Residence, `Administered_Dose1_Pop_Pct`, since the fully vaccinated data is not available. The original picture also indicated in the title that they use the figure of total doses administered for states like CA, GA, IA, MI & TX.

```{r}

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# similar graphs and analyses can be found at 
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )
```


```{r}
#data
glimpse(german_election_polls)
#parties: union, spd, af_d, fdp, linke, grune
#x-axis: by month (since 2021?) - use month variable 
#y-axis: by values (% of party polls)

library(reshape2)
#append variables together: create a column that has the variable name as 1 and the poll as the other, keeping all else attached 

df <- data.frame(Union = german_election_polls$union, SPD = german_election_polls$spd, AfD = german_election_polls$af_d, FDP = german_election_polls$fdp, Linke = german_election_polls$linke, Grune = german_election_polls$grune, time = german_election_polls$week)

#melt the variables together (so we have 3 variables: the week, the party, and the poll number)
df_melt = melt(df, id.vars = "time")

glimpse(df_melt)


```



```{r}
#reproducing the graph 
ggplot(df_melt,aes(x=time,y=value,colour=variable)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs( x = "Weeks since 2021", y = "Estimated poll %", title= "2021 Germany Poll Results", colour="Political Parties")

```
